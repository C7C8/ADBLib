To Implement:

Tier II
	-Robot Positioning System
		-Uses the internal accelerometer and an external gyroscope to get robot position relative to the start position.
Tier III
	-RoboRadar
		-Uses one or more rotating ultrasonic sensors to scan the environmap and return some form of array containing a map of the nearby area.
		-Could be used for autonomous or as a neat way for drivers to drive around better.
		-Uses triangulation. Needs precise measurement information on positioning and rotation.
		-Maybe PID for positioning, maybe just a "here's my measurement, here's the angle it was taken at"-type thing.
