#ADBLib
####(Somewhat) Advanced Dreadbot Library

The simple and stupid library for making programming FRC robots easier.

##Features

* Easy-to-use, fast finite state machines
* Prototype inertial guidance system + pathing system
* New controller type allows for dynamic loading of controls, allowing drivers to have their own control scheme. Also eliminates the need to have hardware IDs in the code.
* Support for a wide variety of drivebases, with the option to easily write your own drivebase, compatible with the rest of the library.
* Global logging support, compatible with RoboRIOs.
* Support for an arbitrary number USB cameras, with easy camera switching/image grabbing
* Support for the MPU6005, a combination gyroscope/accelerometer/magnetomer.
* Simplification/abstraction of pneumatics and PID motors
